# I have finished my second year!

##### ðŸ˜Ž It's been a long time coming, but now it's finally time to go back to writing some fun code! ðŸ˜Ž

I have fiddled with wordaday alot for the last year, but in terms of inspiration, the last month has been a bit of a slog. So now it's time to take it easy and write some code with no deadline, and learn laravel properly!

# About this app:

This application is NOT intended to be super sophisticated, nor does it intend to follow best practices, but i am going to fiddle about with this and just enjoy learning a new framework. The idea of the application is it's a place to store quotes that you like. Nothing more than that. Just a couple of tables, some CRUD and a nice login system.

# We now have some more cool stuff!

> Like System

> Subscription System

### This is a celebration artefact, so don't expect much!

## :shipit: Happy coding! :shipit:
